# Introduction
The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model for determining the price of used cars based on their specifications in a car sales context. The significance lies in assisting both sellers and buyers by providing a reliable estimate of a car's market value, enabling informed decision-making during transactions.

# Dataset
The dataset comprises various attributes such as the car's make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission, engine size, and other relevant specifications. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, particularly regression techniques, this project aims to build and train a robust model using historical data to predict the selling price of a used car. The project will involve data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and potentially performing feature scaling or normalization

# Algorithms I used

OLS assumptions, Variance Inflation factor for outliers, Multicollinearity, Linear Regression, Kmeans Clustering, Mean Square error methods and Lasso Regression
